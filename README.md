*DESCRIPTION*: I developed a Student Management REST API project using Spring Boot, MySQL, and Spring Data JPA, following a structured step-by-step tutorial to understand how CRUD operations are implemented in a real-world backend application. This project is designed to perform basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on student records through a RESTful web service. I started by creating the Spring Boot project in Spring Tool Suite (STS), where I added essential dependencies like Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, DevTools, and the MySQL Connector in the pom.xml file. Using MySQL Workbench, I created the required database schema and established a connection between the application and the MySQL database via the application.properties file. I defined a Student entity class to represent student data in the database, mapping fields such as roll number, name, and department using JPA annotations. The repository layer was implemented using the JpaRepository interface, allowing for seamless interaction with the database without writing boilerplate SQL code. In the controller layer, I created REST endpoints using Spring’s annotation-based approach, such as @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, and @DeleteMapping. The exposed endpoints include GET /students to retrieve all students, GET /student/{rollNo} to fetch a specific student by roll number, POST /student/add to add a new student, PUT /student/update/{id} to update existing student details, and DELETE /student/delete/{id} to remove a student from the database. I tested all the endpoints using Postman to ensure they returned the expected JSON responses and HTTP status codes. I also utilized annotations like @PathVariable to extract data from the URL and @ResponseStatus to define custom HTTP status responses. This project gave me practical experience in building a REST API from scratch using Spring Boot’s layered architecture, reinforcing the concepts of object-relational mapping (ORM), dependency injection, and controller-based routing. It also taught me how to structure a backend application cleanly, maintain readable and modular code, and handle HTTP requests in a robust and RESTful manner. Moreover, integrating the application with MySQL provided insight into real-time data persistence and retrieval using JPA, eliminating the need for manual SQL queries. The development process included continuous testing and debugging, which helped me understand error handling and the importance of status codes in API responses. Through this project, I gained confidence in using Postman for API testing, configuring the application to connect with a relational database, and building full CRUD functionality in a professional Java Spring Boot application. This project not only strengthened my backend development skills but also enhanced my understanding of RESTful service design and deployment practices, making it a valuable addition to my software engineering portfolio.
